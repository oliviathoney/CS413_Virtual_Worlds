##	Instructions
From the home screen, you can choose to start the game or read the instructions. The instructions give a brief overview of the objective of the game. Once the game begins, there is a small box that you can dismiss which outlines the controls of the game. In the upper left hand corner, to the left of the grand stands, you can see the current road piece. In addition, you can view the next road piece as well. This shows up to the left of the current piece, in a smaller box. Click on any green square to place the road in that square. The game is complete when you have successfully connected the start, with the finish. These start and end pieces are already placed at the beginning of the game and have a starting line and a finish line.
