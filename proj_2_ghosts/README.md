##	Ghost Game
*	Olivia Thoney (opt4)
*	Zachary Wilson-Long (zsw23)  
##	Instructions
Use the arrow keys to move the ghost hunter around the rooms. The ghost hunter starts with three lives, which are shown in the bottom right corner of the screen. Running into a ghost will cause you to lose a life and you will lose the game if you lose all three lives. In the first room, avoid the ghosts and get to the stairs. Once in the basement, avoid the ghosts to get the artifact (gold cross with jewels). Once you have the artifact, the ghosts will break from their path to come attack you. You can fight them off by retriving the ghost gun, also located in the basement. To fire the ghost gun, press the space bar. The bullets will fire in whatever direction the ghost hunter is pointing. With the artifact in hand, which you can see next to your lives, navigate back out of the basement to the main floor and all the way back to the start. If you reach the start door with the artifact then you have successfully escaped the haunted palace with the sacred artifact.   
##	Known	Bugs	or	Issues
There is a bug when tranfering to the next room where the player doesn't immediately show up, and/or the controls don't immediately work. The behavior isn't consistent and might do something werid but it always fixes itself and acts normally fairly quickly.
